This is the checklist document of [Jonas Tyroller's framework for commercial success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xej_wsBB5tY).

## Framework


- [ ] **Fun** — for keeping players
- [ ] **Appealing** — for gaining players
- [ ] **Within Scope** — for finishing in a reasonable time
- [ ] **Monetizable** — for paying rent

### Doing more with less
- Avoid concept debates
- Don't over-hire
- Don't try to compete on every dimension
- Don't listen to all feedback
- Fail faster — catch mistakes early
- Avoid constantly rising maintenance costs
- Find areas to leverage multipliers (2X polish results in 4x players)
- Quality of a game needs to grow faster than the costs — easier with smaller games

### Fun & Flow
- Skills must match the challange
- Fast and clear feedback
- Feeling of control
- An environment that allows you to focus
- Only challenge 1 skill in a game (puzzle solving, timing, mechanical skill, decisions making, etc)

## Appeal
- have a strong fantasy
- have a strong presentation
- be easy to understand

Break game into:
> [name] is a [genre] game about [fantasy].
> 
> You [verbs] + [Unique Selling Point]

## Build via pillars
- Prototype to change guesses into decisions
- Treat game development as a prototype graph: prototyping features continually to vet the outcome
- Prototype gameplay and art separately
- prioritize speed over architecture
- test for fun, appeal and scope.
- keep prototypes comparable
- Follow the best ideas / perform search algorithm
- Use your vision of the game to filter prototype results and ideas
